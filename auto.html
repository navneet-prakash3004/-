    Scene 1: Navneet and Anmol are sitting on a park bench. Navneet is holding a map and looking excited. Anmol is reading a book.]

Navneet: (excitedly) Hey Anmol, guess what? I just found this old map in the attic. It looks like it leads to a hidden treasure!

Anmol: (looking up from the book, intrigued) Really? A treasure map? That sounds like something out of a movie. Are you sure it's not just a piece of paper?

Navneet: (nodding eagerly) Im positive! Look at these markings. It shows landmarks around the park. I think we should follow it and see where it leads.

Anmol: (closing the book, smiling) Alright, Im in. But what if it turns out to be just a prank?

Navneet: (grinning) Then well have a fun adventure and maybe discover something interesting along the way!

[Scene 2: Navneet and Anmol start walking along the path, looking at the map and observing the surroundings.]

Navneet: (pointing) The first landmark is supposed to be an old oak tree. It should be just up ahead.

Anmol: (glancing around) There it is! The big oak tree. Whats the next step?

Navneet: (studying the map) It says we need to walk north until we find a stone with a strange inscription on it.

Anmol: (looking at the map) Wait, whats this? (points to a small drawing on the map) It looks like theres a drawing of a bench.

Navneet: (excitedly) Oh, I remember! Theres a bench nearby that has some writing on it. Maybe thats part of the clue!

[Scene 3: Navneet and Anmol reach a bench with an inscription. Navneet takes out a small notebook and writes down the inscription.]

Anmol: (reading the inscription) “To find the final prize, look where the sun sets.” Sounds poetic.

Navneet: (thinking) So, we need to head towards the western side of the park, where the sun sets.

Anmol: (smiling) This is turning out to be quite an adventure. Im glad we decided to do this.

Navneet: (excited) Me too! Lets go find that treasure!

[Scene 4: As they walk towards the western side of the park, they see a small chest partially buried under a tree.]

Navneet: (excitedly) Look, Anmol! That must be it!

Anmol: (carefully opening the chest) Whats inside?

[They open the chest to find it filled with old coins, a few antique trinkets, and a letter.]

Navneet: (reading the letter aloud) “Congratulations, adventurers! This treasure was meant to remind you that the real treasure is the time spent together. Enjoy these tokens and cherish your friendship.”

Anmol: (smiling warmly) Thats really touching. Im glad we went on this adventure.

Navneet: (nodding) Me too. It was an amazing day, nd I couldnt have asked for a better friend to share it with.

Anmol: (grinning) Heres to many more adventures together.

[They high-five and walk off together, chatting and laughing as the sun begins to set.]

[Scene ends with the two friends walking off into the distance, the treasure chest safely in their possession.
